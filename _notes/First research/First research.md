## Outline

1. Modification of the Haldane pseudo-potential
 - [[The Haldane pseudopotential]] of LLL and 1LL
 - [[Effects of cavity coupling]] to the pseudo-potential
2. [[ED of CFL|ED numerics]]
 - reproduce CFL in LLL and Pfaffian states in 1LL
 - CFL-Pfaffian transition via cavity coupling
 3. Generalizing arguments to Moire systems
