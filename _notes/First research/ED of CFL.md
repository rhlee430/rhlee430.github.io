title: Exact Diagonalization of Composite Fermi Liquids
---
In this note, we deal with exact diagonalization of composite fermi liquids. We first construct Bloch state bases of Landau levels, and subsequently write the Hamiltonian and diagonalize it in such bases.

## Bloch Wave Functions

We follow Ref. [^1] for preparing reference states for the diagonalization.
